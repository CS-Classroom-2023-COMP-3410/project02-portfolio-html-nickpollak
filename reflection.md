I spent way too much time trying to solve problems on my own in html instead of using chat gpt to generate a basic format for me to fill it in. I would say this was a really cool project that showed me it's not as hard as I thought to make a basic website that can showcase some basics about yourself. I had fun picking out the pictures and writing a couple facts about myself. Again I wish I hadn't started writing it from scratch, but I figured it out and made something I can show off to my friends and family.
